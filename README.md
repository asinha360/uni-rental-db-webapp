# University Rental Database Webapp

<p align="justify">This project demonstrates the use of simple PHP, HTML, CSS and SQL to create a working rental database that can be hosted locally on any appropriate web server. This project was a great learning experience in the lifecycle of an extremely basic yet effective fullstack development project.</p>

<p align="justify">The project followed these steps: </p>

1. Entity Relationship Diagram creation for conceptual understanding of how the webapp works in the backend.
2. Relational Model implementation to convert it to something closer to a functioning database in the backend.
3. SQL script implementation to have a successfully working backend that can be hosted locally.
4. Frontend creation using simple PHP, HTML and CSS to have a user friendly interaction with the functionality being added through PHP.

<p align="justify">To run this webapp locally: </p>

- Clone repository
- Run rentalDB.sql on a web server (Apache HTTP Server Project is a good option)
- Open the rental.php webpage to start exploring functionality
