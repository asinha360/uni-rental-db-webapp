# University Rental Database Webapp

<p align="justify">This project demonstrates the use of simple PHP, HTML, CSS and SQL to create a working rental database that can be hosted locally on any appropriate web server. This project was a great learning experience in the lifecycle of an extremely basic yet effective fullstack development project.</p>

<p align="justify">The project followed these steps: </p>

<li>
    <ol>Entity Relationship Diagram creation for conceptual understanding of how the webapp works in the backend.</ol>
    <ol>Relational Model implementation to convert it to something closer to a functioning database in the backend.</ol>
    <ol>SQL script implementation to have a successfully working backend that can be hosted locally.</ol>
    <ol>Frontend creation using simple PHP, HTML and CSS to have a user friendly interaction with the functionality being added through PHP.</ol>
</li>

<p align="justify">To run this webapp locally: </p>

<li>
    <ul>Clone repository</ul>
    <ul>Run rentalDB.sql on a web server (Apache HTTP Server Project is a good option)</ul>
    <ul>Open the rental.php webpage to start exploring functionality</ul>
</li>
